To learn OpenGL and Computer Graphics, I wrote a renderer that implemented some
cool computer graphics concepts that I was interested in. This project isn't
meant to be in a production environment or anything, but just served as a way
for me to explore some topics I found interesting such as:
- Water
- Procedural Star Rendering
- Procedural Terrain Generation
- Lighting

You can view the source [here](https://github.com/akash-melachuri/OGL-Engine).

At the time, I was too excited to properly screen record my results, so I am
super sorry for the phone recorded computer screen... But if you are still
interested, here are some demo videos:
