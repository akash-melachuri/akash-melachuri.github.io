This is a pretty simple ray marcher I wrote in ThreeJS. I was inspired by
Sebastian Lague's
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp5WWtMoeKg&pp=ygUcc2ViYXN0aWFuIGxhZ3VlIHJheSBtYXJjaGluZw%3D%3D)
on ray marching. I decided not to use an engine, but wanted to still keep it
simple, so I went with ThreeJS. For working on cool graphics projects just to
learn some new concept or show off something cool to friends, I highly
recommend it.

Look at the [source](https://github.com/akash-melachuri/mArch).

Here are some things I rendered with this ray marcher (sorry for bad quality):

### Mandlebulb
